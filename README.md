# Guess the Number Game

A simple and fun "Guess the Number" game where the player must guess a number chosen by the computer within a specific range. This project showcases the usage of basic JavaScript for interactivity, HTML for structure, and CSS for styling.

## Files

2. Enter your guess in the input field and click the "Submit" button.
